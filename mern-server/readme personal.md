1. after creating mern-server, i first created package.json file using npm init command.

2. then i created index.js file.

3. then i installed express, nodemon, cors, mongodb using npm install. If you have installed nodemon locally for your project, then you have to add a script in your package.json file called 'start'. LOOK AT IT. you can start running the project using the command 'npm start'.

4. then you required cors in index.js file. then you have added the middlewares cors() and express.json().

5. Inside mongodb Atlas, you first created a project, then database access, network access. then you have created a cluster for that project. Then you connected the cluster using nodejs driver and not compass. then you copied the whole sample code.
